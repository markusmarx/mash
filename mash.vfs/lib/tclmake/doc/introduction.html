<h1>Introduction</h1>


<b>tclmake</b> works on exactly the same principles
as <b>make</b>. 
A <i>makefile</i> contains <i>rules</i>, which specify
which files are used to produced which other files, and <i>commands</i>,
which are executed to update files. Here is a sample
rule and command:

<pre>
tclIndex: main.tcl parse.tcl update.tcl
        auto_mkindex [pwd] main.tcl parse.tcl update.tcl
</pre>

The files on the left-hand side of a rule are called
<i>targets</i>, and those on the right are called
<i>dependencies</i>. In this case, the target is
<b>tclIndex</b>, and the dependencies are the three
Tcl files.

<p>The job of <b>tclmake</b> is to see if any of the
targets are out of date, and if they are, to update them.
For example, if <b>tclmake</b> is invoked with
<pre>
    tclmake tclIndex
</pre>

then <b>tclmake</b> looks at the modification dates of <b>tclIndex</b>
and the three Tcl files. If any of the Tcl files is more recent than
<b>tclIndex</b>, or if <b>tclIndex</b> does not exist, then
<b>tclmake</b> executes the command, which updates <b>tclIndex</b>.

<p>The targets given on the command line when <b>tclmake</b> is
invoked are called the <i>goals</i>, since these are the targets that
<b>tclmake</i> will try to update. If no goals are given on the
command line, then <b>tclmake</b> will use the targets of the first
rule in the makefile as its goals.

<p>Dependencies are typically <i>chained</i>. For example,
suppose that each Tcl file also depends on some other
file, such as a source-code control file. In that case,
we might have a rule like this:

<pre>
%.tcl :: SCCS/s.%.tcl
        exec sccs get $<
</pre>

This rule says that any file with the <b>.tcl</b> suffix depends on a
file in the SCCS directory. (The double-colon is explained in <a
href="rules.html#double">Double-colon rules</a>.) Suppose we try to make
<b>tclIndex</b>. <b>tclmake</b> sees that this file depends on
<b>main.tcl</b>. However, instead of just checking the date of
<b>main.tcl</b>, it also sees that <b>main.tcl</b> depends on
<b>SCCS/s.main.tcl</b>, so <b>tclmake</b> then checks whether
<b>SCCS/s.main.tcl</b> is newer than <b>main.tcl</b>.  If it is, it
executes the <b>sccs</b> command, and then executes the command that
updates <b>tclIndex</b>. (If not, then it goes back and compares the
file dates of <b>tclIndex</b> and <b>main.tcl</b>, as before.)

<p>A makefile (or, as I call them in the rest of this document to
distinguish between makefiles for regular <b>make</b> and makefiles
for <b>tclmake</b>, a "tclmakefile") thus captures arbitrarily complex
dependencies between files; <b>tclmake</b> provides the resolution
mechanism that ensures that files are updated or regenerated in the
correct order.
