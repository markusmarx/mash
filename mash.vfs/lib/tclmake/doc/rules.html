<h1>Rules</h1>


<b>tclmake</b> recognizes rules in a subset of <b>make</b> syntax. The
types of rules recognized are:

<ul>
<li><a href="#simple">Simple rules</a>
<li><a href="#phony">Phony targets</a>
<li><a href="#pattern">Pattern rules</a>
<li><a href="#suffix">Suffix rules</a>
<li><a href="#double">Double-colon rules</a>
<li><a href="#optionrules">Option rules</a>
</ul>



<a name="simple">
  <h2>Simple rules</h2>
  </a>
  <p>



Simple rules are rules that contain a colon
but do not contain a percent sign.
<pre>
tclIndex: $(TCL_SRCS)
</pre>

<p>
Targets are to the left; dependencies to the right.  There can be an
arbitrary number of either.  Wild-cards, such as <b>*.tcl</b> can be
used on either side of the colon.

<p>If a target does not exist, or if any of the dependencies are newer
than any of the targets, then that target is out of date, and the
command will be executed to update it. If any dependency is itself a
target (in another rule), then the dependencies will be chained to
determine if the dependency itself needs updating,


  <a name="phony">
  <h2>Phony targets</h2>
  </a>
  <p>


If a target is not the name of a file, then it is
what is called a "phony target". This allows rules
to act almost as procedure calls. For example, a
first rule in a tclmakefile may be:

<pre>
all: tclIndex sources
</pre>

When <b>tclmake</b> attempts to update the goal <b>all</b>, it looks
for a file named <b>all</b>. If it doesn't find one, it recursively
attempts to update the dependencies <b>tclIndex</b> and
<b>sources</b>. The effect is exactly the same as if <b>tclIndex</b>
and <b>sources</b> had been the goals in the first place.

<p>(Unlike regular <b>make</b>, <b>tclmake</b> does not have any means
of specifying which targets are phony.  The way that phony targets
works is somewhat different, but I am not sure yet whether this will
cause problems.)

  <a name="pattern">
  <h2>Pattern rules</h2>
  </a>
  <p>


A pattern rule uses the character <b>%</b> as a place-holder to
match patterns. The general form of this rule is:

<pre>
<i>targets</i> <b>:</b> <i>target-pattern</i>  <b>:</b> <i>dep-pattern</i> 
</pre>

For example, we might have the rule:
<pre>
$(JAVA_CLASSES): %.class : %.java
</pre>

Suppose the <b>hype.class</b> file becomes a goal, then
<b>tclmake</b> will match the pattern <b>%.class</b> against
it, and use <b>hype.java</b> as its dependency.

<p>
More often than not, the initial target list will
be omitted, as in:

<pre>
%.class : %.java
</pre>

In this case, <b>tclmake</b> will try matching the pattern
<b>%.class</b> against any target that becomes a goal. This is less
efficient, but often more convenient.

<p><b>tclmake</b> recognises a special case: the <i>target</i> is
supplied, but it matches no target-patterns, or none of the
dependencies from matching actually exist. In this case,
<b>tclmake</b> does a "reverse" pattern match: it matches the
<i>dependency</i> pattern against existing files, and if any files are
found, updates the corresponding targets.

<p>For example, the default tclmakefile contains the rule

<pre>
sources: % :: SCCS/s.%
        exec sccs get $<
</pre>

The  pattern-match will find  <b>sources</b> as  a target,  and
<b>SCCS/s.sources</b> as a dependency. Since, however, the latter file
does  not exist, <b>tclmake</b> pattern-matches  against  all files in
the  SCCS  directory, with the result that all files with a
new SCCS file will be updated.


  <a name="suffix">
  <h2>Suffix rules</h2>
  </a>
  <p>


A suffix rule consists of two concatenated file suffixes.
For example:
<pre>
.java.class:
</pre>

A suffix rule is an older form of rule. This rule
is equivalent to the rule 
<pre>
%.class : %.java
</pre>


  <a name="double">
  <h2>Double-colon rules</h2>
  </a>
  <p>


Any rule can have a double-colon instead of a single
colon, as in the example

<pre>
%.tcl :: SCCS/s.%.tcl
</pre>

The double-colon means that this rule is a <i>terminator</i>
rule. <b>tclmake</b> will not chain dependencies
in implicit rules. In this example, this means that,
if tclmake finds, say, a file <b>foo.tcl</b>, but no
file named <b>SCCS/s.foo.tcl</b>, it will not
attempt to update a target named <b>SCCS/s.foo.tcl</b>,
which can never be a target.

<p>In other words, use the double-colon when a dependency
is a file that <b>must</b> exist, and cannot be produced
from other files.



  <a name="optionrules">
  <h2>Option rules</h2>
  </a>
  <p>


One of the few extensions <B>tclmake</B> makes to regular <B>make</B>
is the ability to define command-line options in the tclmakefile
itself.  To do so, simply define a rule that has targets beginning
with a leading dash, and with no dependencies. If any of those targets
are specified on the command line, the rule will be run after updating
all other targets.

 <P>So far, the only real use I have come up with for this facility is
for recursive makes. The <B>--recursive</B> and <B>--packages</B>
command-line options are defined in this way. See <A
HREF="recursion.html">Recursive tclmakes</A> for examples.
