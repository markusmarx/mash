<h1>Getting and installing tclmake</h1>


The current distribution is not packaged terribly well, and requires
things to be done by hand.  First, decide where to download the
distribution:

<ul>

<li>Into your Tcl library directory. To see where this
is, start <b>itclsh</b> or <b>tclsh</b> and execute

<pre>
  file dirname [info library]
</pre>

<li>Any location. After downloading into, say
<B>/users/johnr/stuff</B>, set the environment variable
<b>TCLMAKE_LIBRARY</b> to <B>/users/johnr/stuff/tclmake</B>.

</ul>

Download one of these files:

<dl>
<dt><a href="dist/tclmake.tar.gz">tclmake.tar.gz</a>

<dd>To unpack (on Unix), do:
<pre>
    gzcat tclmake.tar.gz | tar -xf -
</pre>

<dt><a href="dist/tclmake.zip">tclmake.zip</a>

<dd>To unpack (Windows or Unix), do:

<pre>
    unzip -a tclmake
</pre>

</dl>

Make sure the file <b>tclmake/bin/tclmake</b> is in your path, by
creating a symbolic link to it or by copying the file into a directory
in the path.

 <P>The default <B>tclmake</B> script starts up <B>itclsh</B>.
Although <B>tclmake</B> does not require Itcl to run, I did this in
order to ensure that index files are made properly when processing
Itcl files. If you do not have <B>itclsh</B>, then change the third
line of the script to <B>tclsh</B> or <B>tclsh80</B> (Windows)
instead.

<p>If you are running under Windows NT, you can:
<ol>

<li>Install the <b>cygwin32</b> user tools, and use <b>bash</b> as
your shell. In that case, the script <b>tclmake</b> will run. (This
somewhat contradicts what I said in the intro page about not having to
install more tools -- however, the user tools includes <b>bash</b> and
stuff like that, without gcc and the other <i>development</i> tools,
and is well worth having!)

<li>Use MS-DOS as your shell. In that case, copy the botch file
<b>bin/tclmake.bat</b> into a directory in your path and modify it so
that it points to the <B>tclmake</B> script.

</ul>

In either case, <B>tclsh</B> or <B>tclsh80</B> must also be in your
path for it to work.
